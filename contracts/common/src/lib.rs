//! Shared error codes for the Accensa contracts.
//!
//! Both [`ReceiptAnchor`] and [`RefundVault`] return errors from this single,
//! canonical [`Error`] enum. Every variant carries an explicit, distinct `u32`
//! value (issue #98). Indexers and frontends can therefore map one code space
//! across all contracts instead of maintaining per-contract tables.
//!
//! Values `4..=18` match the codes historically returned by `RefundVault`.
//! The codes that used to collide between the two contracts
//! (`AlreadyInitialized`, `NotInitialized`, `Unauthorized`) keep their original
//! values, while the `ReceiptAnchor`-only codes (`BatchNotFound`,
//! `BatchTooLarge`) are pushed to a dedicated block so no two variants overlap.
//!
//! # Stability
//!
//! Error codes are part of the contract's public interface and must not be
//! renumbered. New variants are appended with fresh, unused values.
