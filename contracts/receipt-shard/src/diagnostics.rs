//! Shard health diagnostics (issue #419).
//!
//! Indexers and light clients need to check a shard's internal consistency
//! without walking raw storage slots. This module keeps a few O(1) counters,
//! packed into one [`ShardStats`] instance-storage entry so `anchor_batch`
//! pays for a single extra read and write, updated on every anchor and every
//! deletion, and exposes them through the read-only [`ReceiptShard::get_shard_diagnostics`]
//! entry point as a [`ShardDiagnostics`] snapshot.
//!
//! # Counters
//!
//! - `live_batches` / `live_leaves`: batch records currently held in persistent
//!   storage and the sum of their leaf counts. Incremented by `anchor_batch`,
//!   decremented by both pruning paths (`prune_batches`,
//!   `prune_expired_receipts`). Re-anchoring an existing `batch_id` replaces
//!   its contribution instead of double counting.
//! - `total_leaves`: Lifetime number of leaves introduced into this shard;
//     never decreases. Both newly anchored and migrated records contribute.
//! - `high_water`: one past the highest `batch_id` anchored so far (`0`
//!   before the first anchor, reported as `start`).
//! - `max_batch_count`: the largest leaf count of any batch ever anchored,
//!   reported as a Merkle depth (`⌈log₂(count)⌉`).
//!
//! Shards deployed before these counters existed report `0` for them until
//! new batches are anchored; `consistent` stays `true` in that case because
//! every invariant below holds trivially for zero counters.
