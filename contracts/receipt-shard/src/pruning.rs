//! Storage eviction policy for expired receipt-shard entries (issue #395).
//!
//! While `ReceiptShard::prune_batches` prunes by *cursor position* (a
//! contiguous prefix keyed by batch id, router-gated), this module adds a
//! policy-driven eviction path: batches whose anchor ledger is older than
//! the retention window may be deleted to reclaim persistent-storage rent,
//! and whoever triggers the cleanup accrues a per-batch bounty they can
//! claim from the contract's own token balance.
//!
//! # Policy
//!
//! - [`RETENTION_LEDGERS`] (~180 days at ~5 s/ledger) is the protocol
//!   retention period. A batch is prunable only when
//!   `current_ledger - batch.anchored_ledger >= RETENTION_LEDGERS`;
//!   anything younger is active under the dispute/retention window and is
//!   never touched, so `prune_expired_receipts` can never delete an
//!   unexpired receipt.
//! - `max_count` bounds the deletions per call (and therefore the bounty
//!   payout), keeping the loop's cost predictable.
//! - Every call emits [`ReceiptsPrunedEvent`] with the reclaimed storage
//!   count, even when it deletes nothing (count `0`).
//!
//! # Bounty economics
//!
//! Each pruned batch accrues [`PRUNE_BOUNTY_PER_BATCH`] stroops to the
//! cleanup caller in instance storage (`DataKey::PruneBounty`), keyed by
//! the caller's address. The caller identifies itself by passing its own
//! address and authorizing the call with `require_auth` — the same
//! authorize-by-argument pattern every other contract in this workspace
//! uses — so bounty attribution is sound and a third party cannot divert
//! someone else's accrual to itself. The accrued balance is settled
//! through `claim_prune_bounty`, which zeroes the accrual *before* the
//! transfer so a claim cannot pay out twice.
