//! Dispute-window timing helpers for the state channel contract (issue #387).
//!
//! A cooperative close starts a challenge window (`closed_at +
//! challenge_period`) during which the receiver may file a dispute. Filing
//! the dispute transitions the channel into [`ChannelPhase::Disputed`] and
//! re-arms the window from the ledger the dispute was initiated
//! (`disputed_at + challenge_period`). While that window is open, anyone
//! holding a sender-signed, newer state may submit **counter-evidence**
//! (each accepted state re-arms the window). Once the window elapses with no
//! counter-evidence, the channel is settled strictly per the **last verified
//! state** via `finalize_dispute`, paid to anyone.
//!
//! These helpers centralise the two boundary checks — "window still open"
//! and "window has elapsed" — used by `dispute`, `submit_counter_evidence`
//! and `finalize_dispute` in the contract implementation, so the timing
//! rules stay consistent and unit-testable.
