//! Verifiable randomness (VRF) seed derivation from verified VDF output
//! (issue #429).
//!
//! A completed Verifiable Delay Function evaluation is a natural randomness
//! beacon: its output `y = x^(2^T) mod N` cannot be known until all `T`
//! sequential squarings have been performed, and no participant can choose it
//! after the fact without breaking the adaptive-root assumption (see
//! [`crate::vdf`]). This module turns a *verified* Wesolowski proof into a
//! 256-bit seed that consumer contracts — lottery draws, validator selection,
//! tie-breaking — can read deterministically.
//!
//! # Why the seed is unbiasable
//!
//! - The challenge is bound to the proposal identifier:
//!   `x = sha256(vdf_id)` zero-extended to 128 bytes. A prover cannot select a
//!   different challenge to steer the output; changing `vdf_id` changes `x`.
//! - [`crate::vdf::verify_vdf`] refuses any proof whose output did not come
//!   from `T` genuine squarings of that challenge, so only a *verified* output
//!   is ever hashed.
//! - The seed is `sha256(output || vdf_id || T)`: a one-way function of the
//!   transcript. Nobody — not the prover, not the proposal author — can
//!   predict or bias it before the delay elapses, because doing so would
//!   require predicting `y` (or inverting SHA-256).
//! - Derivation is **deterministic**: the same verified transcript always
//!   yields the same seed, so independent observers can reproduce it and
//!   [`get_verified_randomness`](VdfPolicy::get_verified_randomness) is a
//!   stable read rather than a mutable lottery ticket.
//!
//! The ledger number is deliberately *not* part of the seed, so a consumer can
//! recompute the expected value off-chain; it is only recorded alongside the
//! seed for auditability.
