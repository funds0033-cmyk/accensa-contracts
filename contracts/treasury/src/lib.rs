//! Token vesting treasury (issue #467) with diversified yield (issue #466).
//!
//! Deploys a token allocation contract that releases core team and investor
//! allocations linearly over a four-year period after a one-year cliff. The
//! admin funds the contract once and registers one [`VestingSchedule`] per
//! beneficiary; from then on a beneficiary may call [`Treasury::claim_vested`]
//! at any time to pull out whatever has unlocked but not yet been paid.
//!
//! Idle reserves — the balance that is not backing a live vesting claim — can
//! additionally be parked in several whitelisted yield protocols. Governance
//! picks the split; [`Treasury::rebalance_portfolio`] rotates the portfolio
//! onto it and [`Treasury::recall_strategy`] brings any position home. See
//! [`strategies`] for the model.
//!
//! # Model
//!
//! - **Time is wall-clock.** Vesting is measured against
//!   `env.ledger().timestamp()` (Unix seconds), so a schedule means the same
//!   length of time whatever the network's ledger rate turns out to be. See
//!   [`vesting`] for the release curve.
//! - **Unlocked, not schedule-driven.** There is no keeper and no per-claim
//!   schedule: [`Treasury::claim_vested`] pays out everything unlocked at the
//!   current ledger, so being late costs nothing and being early is
//!   impossible.
//! - **Never over-pays.** The contract only ever transfers
//!   `vested(now) - claimed`, and the ceiling is the schedule's `total`. A
//!   second claim in the same ledger is rejected with
//!   [`Error::NothingToClaim`].
//! - **Per-beneficiary auth.** A claim requires the beneficiary's own
//!   authorization, so an allocation can never be pulled by anyone else.
//!
//! Administered by a single admin address that creates schedules. There is no
//! revoke path in this MVP: changing or clawing back a live allocation is a
//! governance decision that this contract deliberately does not encode.
//!
//! The contract also hosts the protocol's governance-token **buyback and
//! burn** hook (issue #465): see [`buyback`].
