## The Problem

x402 turns any HTTP endpoint into a paid resource: an AI agent hits your API, gets a
`402 Payment Required`, pays, and retries. That works — but it leaves both sides
without recourse.

**The agent cannot prove it was charged correctly.** Its receipt comes from the
seller's own API, attesting to payment without ledger backing. If the seller goes
offline, ghosts a refund, or double-bills, the agent has no recourse.

**The merchant has no liability cap.** Holding user float directly invites hacks
and disputes.

## The Solution

Accensa bridges x402 to Stellar via two Soroban smart contracts:

1. **ReceiptAnchor** — Merchants batch and anchor payment receipt roots on-chain using Merkle trees, giving agents verifiable proof of payment that survives server loss.
2. **RefundVault** — A policy-bounded vault holding merchant float for automated refunds, restricted by time windows, balance limits, and merchant authorization.

## Enforced Invariants & Test Coverage Mapping

Enforced invariants, each covered by a test:

- **No double refunds** — a `payment_ref` can only be refunded once (`AlreadyRefunded`).
  *Mapped Test:* `contracts/refund-vault/src/test.rs` -> `test_double_refund_same_payment_ref_fails`
- **Time-bounded** — refunds past `refund_window_ledgers` are rejected (`WindowExpired`).
  *Mapped Test:* `contracts/refund-vault/src/test.rs` -> `test_refund_outside_window_fails`, `test_refund_at_window_boundary_succeeds`
- **Float-bounded** — a refund can never exceed vault balance (`InsufficientFloat`).
  *Mapped Test:* `contracts/refund-vault/src/test.rs` -> `test_refund_exceeding_float_fails`, `test_withdraw_exceeding_float_fails`
- **Merchant-only** — every state-changing call requires merchant/admin auth (`Unauthorized`), with the explicit exception of `initialize` (which initializes the contract instance and does not require prior auth, see #145).
  *Mapped Tests:* `contracts/refund-vault/src/test.rs` -> `test_refund_requires_merchant_auth`, `test_deposit_from_non_merchant_fails`, `test_pause_requires_merchant_auth`, `test_unpause_requires_merchant_auth`, `test_transfer_admin_requires_auth`, `test_cancel_admin_transfer_requires_auth`, `test_accept_admin_requires_pending_auth`; `contracts/receipt-anchor/src/test.rs` -> `test_anchor_batch_requires_merchant_auth`, `test_prune_batches_requires_admin_auth`
- **Pausable** — operations are halted if the vault is paused (`Paused`).
  *Mapped Test:* `contracts/refund-vault/src/test.rs` -> `test_refund_when_paused_fails`, `test_deposit_when_paused_fails`, `test_withdraw_when_paused_fails`
This design is only economical on Stellar:

- **Sub-cent fees make per-request payments viable at all.** x402 is about
  micropayments; on most chains the settlement fee exceeds the payment itself.
- **Batched anchoring amortises to near zero.** One `anchor_batch` call covers an
  entire billing period, so verifiability costs a fraction of a cent per receipt.
- **USDC is native.** Merchant float and refunds settle in the asset merchants
  actually price in, through the Stellar Asset Contract, with no bridge.
- **Soroban's fee model is predictable**, so a merchant can bound the cost of their
  refund policy in advance rather than guessing at gas.

## Contracts

### `ReceiptAnchor`

Stores Merkle roots of batched payment receipts so agents can independently verify
they were charged correctly, with no trusted API in the path.

Receipts are partitioned into **logical shards**. Every batch-scoped call takes a
leading `shard_id: u64`, and each `shard_id` owns a fully independent batch
stream: its own `batch_id` sequence (starting at 1), its own duplicate-root
check, its own historical root ring buffer, and its own prune cursor. This lets a
merchant keep several concurrent Merkle roots live at once (per region, per asset
type, per settlement pipeline) instead of serialising everything through one
root. `shard_id` values are caller-chosen and need not be contiguous.

Batch records themselves live in `ReceiptShard` **storage shards** that the anchor
factory-deploys on demand — one per `SHARD_CAPACITY` (200) batches within a
`shard_id`'s stream. The anchor is the router; it holds only the
`(shard_id, capacity_index) -> Address` map.

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `initialize(merchant, shard_wasm_hash)` | Binds the contract to a merchant admin address and pins the `ReceiptShard` wasm hash used to deploy storage shards. |
| `anchor_batch(shard_id, root, count, period_start, period_end) -> u64` | Anchors a batch root into `shard_id`'s stream, returns its `batch_id`. Merchant auth required. `count` must be $\le$ 1000 (`MAX_BATCH_SIZE`). Rejects `DuplicateRoot` if `root` equals that shard's latest root. Rate-limited if a rate limit is configured. |
| `anchor_batch_zk(shard_id, state_root, proof, count, period_start, period_end) -> u64` | Anchors a batch into `shard_id`'s stream by verifying a ZK validity proof of the batch state root. |
| `verify_zk_proof(proof, vk, public_inputs) -> bool` | Verifies a Groth16 zero-knowledge proof against public inputs in $O(1)$ time. |
| `get_batch(shard_id, batch_id) -> BatchRecord` | Reads an anchored batch from `shard_id`'s stream. |
| `get_batch_count(shard_id) -> u64` | Returns the number of batches anchored for `shard_id`. `0` for an unused shard; `NotInitialized` before `initialize`. Read-only. |
| `get_admin() -> Address` | Returns the configured merchant admin address. Read-only; fails with `NotInitialized` before `initialize`. |
| `get_pruned_up_to(shard_id) -> u64` | Returns `shard_id`'s `ShardPrunedUpTo` cursor: the lower bound of that shard's pruned prefix. `1` for an unused shard; `NotInitialized` before `initialize`. Read-only. |
| `get_max_batch_size() -> u32` | Returns `MAX_BATCH_SIZE` (currently 1000). Read-only; clients should discover the limit via this getter rather than hard-coding it. |
| `set_anchor_rate_limit(burst_capacity, refill_interval_secs)` | Configures the token-bucket rate limit on `anchor_batch`. `{0, 0}` disables it. Merchant auth required. The limiter is global per merchant, not per shard. |
| `get_anchor_rate_limit() -> RateLimitConfig` | Returns the current rate-limit config. Read-only. |
| `verify_receipt(shard_id, batch_id, leaf, proof) -> bool` | Verifies a receipt against the root anchored at `batch_id` in `shard_id`'s stream. Read-only, free to call. Returns `ProofTooLong` if the proof exceeds `MAX_PROOF_LEN` (10). |
| `verify_receipt_by_root(shard_id, root, leaf, proof) -> bool` | Verifies a receipt against any root in `shard_id`'s historical ring buffer. Root history is isolated per shard: a root anchored in one shard is not verifiable by root in another. Returns `ProofTooLong` if the proof exceeds `MAX_PROOF_LEN`. |
| `get_root_buffer(shard_id) -> Vec<BytesN<32>>` | Returns `shard_id`'s ring buffer of historical roots. Read-only. |
| `get_root_buffer_size() -> u32` | Returns `ROOT_BUFFER_SIZE` (currently 100). Read-only. |
| `get_shard_root(shard_id) -> BytesN<32>` | Returns `shard_id`'s latest anchored root. `BatchNotFound` if that shard has anchored nothing. Read-only. |
| `get_shard_ids() -> Vec<u64>` | Returns every `shard_id` that has anchored at least one batch, in first-use order. Read-only. |
| `get_shard_capacity() -> u64` | Returns `SHARD_CAPACITY` (currently 200): batches per storage shard. Read-only. |
| `get_shard_count(shard_id) -> u64` | Returns how many storage shards hold `shard_id`'s stream. Read-only. |
| `get_shard_address(shard_id, shard_index) -> Address` | Returns the `ReceiptShard` contract holding `shard_id`'s `shard_index`-th capacity range. `BatchNotFound` if not yet deployed. Read-only. |
| `get_max_proof_len() -> u32` | Returns `MAX_PROOF_LEN` (currently 10). Read-only; clients should discover the limit via this getter. |
| `extend_batch_ttl(shard_id, batch_id)` | Extends the TTL of a batch to prevent archival. Publicly callable. |
| `prune_batches(shard_id, before_ledger)` | Deletes `shard_id`'s anchored batches older than `before_ledger` to reclaim rent. Merchant auth required. |

Pruning walks forward from `shard_id`'s own `ShardPrunedUpTo` cursor and stops at
the first batch that is not old enough, so the deleted range always stays a
contiguous prefix **within that shard** — a batch is never removed from the
middle while older ones remain readable. Shards prune independently; pruning one
shard never touches another.

`MAX_BATCH_SIZE` (1000) caps how many receipts may appear in one `anchor_batch`. Call `get_max_batch_size` to discover the limit at runtime instead of hard-coding it.

Emits:

| Event | Topics | Data |
|---|---|---|
| `InitializedEvent` | `("initialized_event", merchant)` | `shard_wasm_hash`, `ledger` |
| `Receipt` anchor action | `("receipt", "anchor", anchor_id)` | `schema_version`, `timestamp`, `root`, `shard_id`, `count`, `period_start`, `period_end`, `anchored_ledger` |
| `Receipt` prune action | `("receipt", "prune", anchor_id)` | `schema_version`, `timestamp`, `shard_id`, `start_batch_id`, `end_batch_id` |
| `ShardCreatedEvent` | `("shard_created_event", shard_id, shard_index)` | `shard_address`, `start_batch_id`, `end_batch_id` |
| `RateLimitUpdatedEvent` | `("rate_limit_updated_event", previous_burst_capacity, previous_refill_interval_secs)` | `new_burst_capacity`, `new_refill_interval_secs`, `ledger` |
| `AnchorIntervalUpdatedEvent` | `("anchor_interval_updated_event", previous_interval)` | `new_interval`, `ledger` |

The `AnchorEvent` data map mirrors `BatchRecord`, so an indexer decodes it with the same
shape `get_batch` returns. Because `batch_id` is only unique within a `shard_id`,
indexers must key on the `(shard_id, batch_id)` pair. `PruneEvent` is emitted only
when a `prune_batches` call actually deletes batches (the closed range
`[start_batch_id, end_batch_id]`). See
[`docs/EVENTS.md`](docs/EVENTS.md) for the pinned topic tuples.

Proofs use **sorted-pair SHA-256**: siblings are concatenated smaller-hash-first, so
proofs carry no left/right position flags. The TypeScript SDK in
[`accensa-app`](https://github.com/accensa/accensa-app) implements the identical
convention, and both are checked against the same anchored batch on testnet — see
[DEPLOYMENTS.md](DEPLOYMENTS.md#verifying-the-live-deployment-yourself).

### `RefundVault`

Holds merchant float and executes refunds bounded by an on-chain policy.

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `__constructor(VaultInit)` / `initialize(VaultInit)` | Constructor-wired initialization: sets admin (merchant), settlement token, policy addresses, fee, refund window, deadline, and VDF delay in one call. There is no post-deployment `initialize` window. |
| `deposit(from, amount)` | Merchant tops up float. |
| `refund(payment_ref, recipient, amount, paid_at_ledger, payment_amount, vdf_proof, nonce)` | Refunds part or all of a payment, subject to policy. `amount` is added to the cumulative total for `payment_ref`; `payment_amount` is the original payment amount and the hard ceiling on cumulative refunds. A configured fee (if any) is deducted before the payout. `vdf_proof` is `Option<BytesN<256>>` — the 128-byte output `x^(2^T) mod N` concatenated with the 128-byte Wesolowski witness — required only when the policy carries a VDF delay (see below). `nonce` is the caller's current per-user replay-protection nonce (issue #122); see [Security Model §Replay Attacks](docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md#replay-attacks). |
| `claim_batch(claims, nonce)` | Refunds multiple claims in one transaction (`Vec<RefundClaim>`, one struct per `refund` call). Atomic: one failing claim reverts the whole batch. One merchant signature, one reentrancy lock, and a `RefundEvent` per claim. Per-element float checks mean it can never overdraw the vault. `nonce` is the caller's current per-user replay-protection nonce. |
| `process_batch(refunds, nonce)` | Best-effort batch refunds (`Vec<RefundParam>`, same shape as `RefundClaim`). Returns `Vec<bool>` — one entry per claim (`true` = applied), and a failing claim does **not** roll back the others. Capped at 100 claims per call (`BatchTooLarge`). Every claim runs the identical per-claim logic as `refund`, including the policy deadline check and the configured fee. Non-atomic by design: use `claim_batch` when all-or-nothing semantics are required. An empty batch is a no-op that returns early and does **not** consume a nonce. |
| `withdraw(amount, to)` | Merchant withdraws float. |
| `propose_policy(ledgers, deadline, vdf_delay)` | Proposes a new refund policy — a window (in ledgers), a wall-clock deadline (Unix timestamp; `0` = no deadline), and a VDF delay in squarings (`0` = none); subject to timelock. |
| `execute_policy()` | Executes a pending policy change after the timelock. Applies the new window, deadline, and VDF delay. |
| `get_pending_policy()` | Returns the current pending policy proposal, if any. |
| `get_policy_timelock()` | Returns the policy timelock delay in ledgers (read-only). |
| `get_refund_deadline()` | Returns the configured policy deadline as a Unix timestamp (`0` = none, read-only). |
| `get_vdf_delay()` | Returns the policy's VDF delay in squarings (`0` = none, read-only). |
| `verify_vdf(challenge, delay, proof)` | Read-only, unauthenticated Wesolowski VDF verifier against the contract's fixed 1024-bit modulus — the surface for randomness-verification flows that never touch the vault. Returns `InvalidVdfProof` if the proof does not verify. |
| `set_fee_bps(bps)` | Sets the refund fee rate in basis points (0–10_000, default 0). Merchant auth, emits `FeeConfigUpdatedEvent`. |
| `set_fee_recipient(recipient)` | Sets the address that collects the refund fee; rejects the vault's own address. Merchant auth, emits `FeeConfigUpdatedEvent`. |
| `get_fee_bps()` | Returns the configured fee rate in basis points (read-only). |
| `get_fee_recipient()` | Returns the configured fee recipient, if any (read-only; falls back to the merchant at claim time). |
| `set_tier_ladder(tiers)` | Installs (or replaces) the merchant fee ladder — a strictly increasing `Vec<MerchantTier>` (`min_settled` volume → `fee_bps`), first rung at volume `0`, at most `MAX_TIERS` (16) rungs. Merchant auth, emits `MerchantTierLadderUpdated`. While a ladder is installed it is the source of truth for the fee and overrides `set_fee_bps`. |
| `clear_tier_ladder()` | Removes the ladder and its progress, restoring the flat `set_fee_bps` rate. Merchant auth. |
| `get_tier_ladder() -> Option<Vec<MerchantTier>>` | Returns the installed fee ladder, if any (read-only). |
| `get_tier_state() -> Option<MerchantTierState>` | Returns the merchant's settled refund volume, active rung, and next promotion threshold (read-only). |
| `get_effective_fee_bps() -> u32` | Returns the fee the next claim will charge: the active tier's rate when a ladder is installed, otherwise `get_fee_bps()`. |
| `get_refund(payment_ref) -> Option<RefundRecord>` | Looks up a refund. |
| `get_user_nonce(caller) -> u64` | Returns the caller's current replay-protection nonce (issue #122) — the `nonce` the caller's next `refund`/`claim_batch`/`process_batch` call must supply. Starts at `0`; increments on every successful claim call. |
| `set_time_policy_contract(address)` | Wires (or clears) the stateless time-policy contract the vault delegates its window/deadline gate to. Merchant auth. |
| `set_vdf_policy_contract(address)` | Wires (or clears) the stateless VDF-policy contract the vault delegates its proof gate to. Merchant auth. |
| `get_time_policy_contract() / get_vdf_policy_contract() -> Option<Address>` | Returns the delegated policy contract addresses, if any. A `None` on an active gate means claims fail closed with `PolicyContractsNotConfigured`. |
| `add_oracle(oracle)` | Whitelists an oracle contract implementing the standard `Oracle` interface (`get_price` + `get_last_update_ledger`); merchant auth required. |
| `remove_oracle(oracle)` | Removes an oracle from the whitelist; merchant auth required. |
| `get_oracles() -> Vec<Address>` | Returns the oracle whitelist, in insertion order (read-only). |
| `get_median_price(feed_id, max_staleness_ledgers) -> Result<i128, Error>` | Queries every whitelisted oracle for the feed and returns the **median** of the fresh (non-stale) values. |
| `set_oracle_policy(policy)` | Installs the dynamic oracle policy that gates refunds; merchant auth required. |
| `clear_oracle_policy()` | Removes the dynamic oracle policy, restoring time-window-only refunds; merchant auth required. |
| `get_oracle_policy() -> Option<OraclePolicy>` | Returns the current oracle policy, if any (read-only). |
| `pause()` | Pauses operations for emergency stops. Merchant auth required. |
| `unpause()` | Resumes paused operations. Merchant auth required. |
| `extend_refund_ttl(payment_ref)` | Extends the TTL of a refund record to prevent archival. Publicly callable. |

**Config getters are individual, not a batch `get_config`.** Exposing the four
stored values as separate read-only calls (`get_admin`, `get_token`,
`get_refund_window`, `is_paused`) — rather than a single struct-returning
`get_config` — keeps the publish ABI compositional and stable as new
configuration is added: a client that only needs one value reads exactly one
storage key, the `#[contracttype]` payload does not change shape when config
grows, and the `is_paused` distinction (missing admin ⇒ `NotInitialized`,
initialized ⇒ `false`) could not be expressed faithfully in one struct anyway.
The status quo is the supported way to read config; do not decode raw ledger
entries by storage key (see issue #195).

### Merchant fee tiers

A merchant can be **promoted through a fee ladder** as the vault settles refund
volume for them: `set_tier_ladder` installs a strictly increasing list of
`MerchantTier` rungs (`min_settled` volume → `fee_bps`), the first of which must
start at `0` so every merchant is always on some rung. Each successful refund
accrues its gross amount into the merchant's settled volume; crossing a rung
promotes the merchant and emits `MerchantTierPromoted`.

The fee in force for a claim is resolved once at the start of the entry point
and shared across a batch, so a rung crossed by claim *N* applies from claim
*N + 1* on — never retroactively within the same call. Without a ladder the flat
[`set_fee_bps`](#refund-vault) rate applies exactly as before, and the tier
bookkeeping costs nothing beyond one cached instance-storage read. An invalid
ladder is rejected with `Error::InvalidTierLadder` (325).

Emits:

| Event | Topics | Data |
|---|---|---|
| `DepositEvent` | `("deposit_event", from)` | `amount` |
| `RefundEvent` | `("refund_event", payment_ref)` | `amount` (this call), `fee` (this call), `cumulative_refunded`, `recipient`, `ledger` |
| `WithdrawEvent` | `("withdraw_event", to)` | `amount` |
| `PauseEvent` | `("pause_event", ledger)` | — |
| `UnpauseEvent` | `("unpause_event", ledger)` | — |
| `RefundWindowUpdatedEvent` | `("refund_window_updated_event", previous_window, new_window)` | — |
| `OraclePolicySetEvent` | `("oracle_policy_set_event", feed_id)` | `threshold`, `refund_when_below`, `max_staleness_ledgers` |
| `OraclePolicyClearedEvent` | `("oracle_policy_cleared_event", feed_id)` | — |

Each partial refund emits its own `RefundEvent` carrying **both** the amount for
that call (`amount`) and the running total (`cumulative_refunded`), so an indexer
knows the state of a payment without summing history. A batch of claims emits one
`RefundEvent` per item, in claim order. `RefundRecord` stores the
cumulative total (`amount_refunded`) plus the `payment_amount` ceiling, the
`paid_at_ledger` the window is measured from, and the recipient. When a fee is
configured, each `RefundEvent` also carries the `fee` deducted from the claim,
and the fee is paid to the `fee_recipient` alongside the recipient's payout.

`process_batch` deliberately emits **one** `BatchRefundEvent` for the whole batch
instead of one `RefundEvent` per item: a per-refund event costs ~530 bytes of
contract-event budget, and mainnet caps a transaction at 16 KiB — so 50+ refunds
would not fit if each emitted its own event. The token contract's per-refund
`transfer` event (unavoidable) dominates what remains, which is why
`MAX_REFUND_BATCH_SIZE` is 50.

**Cross-Contract Joins** (both claims below are pinned by tests in
`contracts/refund-vault/tests/integration_test.rs`):
- **`payment_ref` ↔ receipt-leaf** *(covered by `readme_claim_payment_ref_is_receipt_leaf`)*: The `payment_ref` used to key refunds is identical to the `leaf` hash of the payment receipt anchored in `ReceiptAnchor`. This 1:1 mapping guarantees that the on-chain refund explicitly corresponds to the exact payment record provided to the agent.
- **Refunds outlive pruned batches** *(covered by `readme_claim_refunds_outlive_pruned_batches`)*: Archiving or pruning a batch in `ReceiptAnchor` has no effect on the `RefundVault`. A payment can be successfully refunded even if its original anchor batch has been pruned, provided it still falls within the refund window.

**VDF Fairness** — policies can carry a Verifiable Delay Function delay
(`propose_policy(..., vdf_delay)`). When configured, finalizing a refund
requires a valid [Wesolowski VDF proof](contracts/refund-vault/src/vdf.rs)
that `vdf_delay` sequential squarings have genuinely elapsed. The delay is
*computational*: unlike the ledger window or wall-clock deadline, a validator
that controls block timestamps or transaction ordering cannot shorten it, and
the proof is bound to the payment (`challenge = sha256(payment_ref)`), so it
cannot be replayed across payments. Proofs are generated off-chain by the
merchant's refund agent; the contract only verifies, in ≈51k CPU units (~a
tenth of a refund call). See `docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md` § "VDF Fairness" for
the threat model and the modulus-ceremony note.

Enforced invariants, each covered by a test:

- **Partial refunds within a ceiling** — a `payment_ref` may be refunded across
  multiple calls, but cumulative refunds can never exceed the original
  `payment_amount`; an over-ceiling call is rejected (`ExceedsPayment`). A batch
  accumulates against the same ceiling across its own elements.
- **Atomic batches** — `claim_batch` is all-or-nothing: a single failing claim
  reverts the transfers, records and events of every claim in the call.
- **Per-item float bound** — the float is read from the token contract before
  every claim (single or batched), so a batch can never overdraw the vault any
  more than the equivalent set of single refunds (`InsufficientFloat`).
- **Window from the original payment** — the refund window is measured from
  `paid_at_ledger` (the original payment), never extended by a partial
  (`WindowExpired`).
- **Deadline from the policy** — refunds stop being claimable once the
  configured wall-clock deadline has strictly passed (`RefundExpired`); a
  deadline of `0` disables expiry.
- **Fee-bounded split** — when configured, each claim is split into the
  recipient's payout and a fee that rounds **up** (sub-unit remainders accrue
  to the fee recipient); `payout + fee == amount` exactly, so the fee never
  expands the claim, the `payment_amount` ceiling, or the float check. Without
  a configured recipient the fee defaults to the merchant.
- **Float-bounded** — a refund can never exceed vault balance (`InsufficientFloat`).
- **Merchant-only** — every state-changing call requires merchant auth
  (`Unauthorized`); the admin may be a contract account (see
  [`docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md`](docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md#1-the-admin-merchant)).
- **Pausable** — operations are halted if the vault is paused (`Paused`).
- **Refund ceiling** — a refund for an `upto` payment cannot exceed the amount actually settled. Authorization caps are not refundable balances. Unsettled or expired authorizations cannot be refunded.

**Dynamic (oracle-gated) policies** — beyond the static refund window, the
merchant can install an `OraclePolicy` so refunds are only paid out while an
externally-sourced value satisfies a condition (e.g. *"refund while the asset
price is below the SLA floor"*). The vault never trusts a single feed:
whitelisted oracles implement the standard `Oracle` interface
(`get_price` / `get_last_update_ledger`), the aggregator queries all of them
and takes the **median** of the fresh values, and a value older than the
policy's `max_staleness_ledgers` is excluded. If no oracle is whitelisted, or
every whitelisted oracle is stale, the vault **fails closed**
(`NoOraclesConfigured` / `StaleOracleData`) rather than guessing; a refund
rejected by the condition returns `OraclePolicyDenied`. The gate applies to
both `refund` and every item of `process_batch`. See
[`docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md`](docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md#6-the-oracle-aggregator-optional)
for the trust model.

### `RefundVaultFactory`

Deploys constructor-wired `RefundVault` instances for many merchants off a
single factory. The factory owns the inputs a merchant must not pick —
the vault `wasm_hash` and the addresses of the stateless policy contracts —
and binds each deployment to the merchant via `require_auth`, so a merchant
cannot grief another's deterministic salt family.

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `deploy_vault(VaultInit)` -> Address | Deploys a vault configured by the init struct. Requires the merchant's auth. Returns the vault address deterministically (salt = `sha256(merchant ‖ counter)`). |
| `__constructor(admin, vault_wasm_hash, time_policy, vdf_policy)` | Sets the factory admin, the vault wasm hash the factory may deploy, and the default policy addresses. |
| `set_vault_wasm(hash)` | Swaps the vault `wasm_hash` used for future deployments (admin only). |
| `set_time_policy_contract(address)` / `set_vdf_policy_contract(address)` | Rotates the default policy addresses future vaults fall back to (admin only). |
| `get_vaults() / get_next_salt()` | Operator inspection: deployed vaults and the per-merchant salt counter. |

Policy resolution: a policy set on the merchant's `VaultInit` wins; `None`
falls back to the factory's global policy address. A vault deployed with a
`None` policy on an active gate is nevertheless created and refuses that gate
at claim time with `PolicyContractsNotConfigured` (317) — the factory
operator's job is to never let that happen. See the
[Mainnet Deployment Guide](docs/MAINNET_DEPLOYMENT.md) for the factory
deployment and configuration steps.

### `RefundPolicy` (time and VDF)

Policy contracts that evaluate a single claim and return `Ok(())` or an error —
kept outside the vault so per-vault storage and upgrade surface stay small, and
so operators can adjust claim gating for every vault at once by repointing the
factory default. Claim evaluation is stateless; the one stateful surface is
`VdfPolicy`'s optional randomness registry (issue #429), described below.

- **`TimePolicy`** (`contracts/refund-policy-time`): rejects a claim outside
  the configured refund window or past the configured wall-clock deadline.
- **`VdfPolicy`** (`contracts/refund-policy-vdf`): requires a valid Wesolowski
  VDF proof bound to the payment (`challenge = sha256(payment_ref)`), enforcing
  a *computational* delay a validator cannot shorten. It also exposes a
  **verifiable-randomness registry** (issue #429) built on the same verifier:
  `generate_randomness(vdf_id, delay, proof)` verifies a proof against
  `sha256(vdf_id)` and records the 256-bit seed
  `sha256(output || vdf_id || delay)` under `DataKey::Randomness(vdf_id)`, which
  `get_verified_randomness` / `has_randomness` / `get_randomness_record` read
  back. Derivation is deterministic and idempotent — the first verified proof
  wins, so a consumer cannot be re-targeted to a different seed. The seed is
  unpredictable and unbiasable until the delay elapses, so it can back lottery
  draws, validator selection, and tie-breaking.

Both implement the same minimal interface an arbitrary custom policy can
implement: `evaluate(params: Bytes, ctx: PolicyContext) -> Result<(), Error>`.

## Error Codes

Both contracts return errors from a **single, shared enum** in
[`contracts/common`](contracts/common/src/lib.rs) (issue #98). Every variant has
an explicit, distinct `u32` value, so a frontend keeps one mapping across both
contracts instead of per-contract tables.

| Code | Variant | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `AlreadyInitialized` | `initialize` called twice. |
| 2 | `NotInitialized` | State-changing call before `initialize`. |
| 3 | `Unauthorized` | Caller is not the authorized merchant/admin. |
| 4 | `AlreadyRefunded` | Legacy single-refund marker (pre-#99). Retained for interface stability; the vault reports `ExceedsPayment` (19) for over-ceiling and legacy records since cumulative partial refunds. |
| 5 | `WindowExpired` | Refund window (from the original payment) has expired. |
| 6 | `InsufficientFloat` | Vault float is insufficient. |
| 7 | `InvalidAmount` | Amount was not strictly positive. |
| 8 | `Paused` | Vault is paused. |
| 9 | `RefundNotFound` | No refund record for the payment ref. |
| 12 | `NoPendingTransfer` | No admin transfer pending. |
| 13 | `StrategyNotSet` | No yield strategy configured. |
| 14 | `InsufficientReserve` | Yield deployment would breach the minimum reserve. |
| 15 | `DeploymentExceedsMax` | Yield deployment would exceed the max ratio. |
| 16 | `NothingToWithdraw` | Nothing to withdraw from the yield strategy. |
| 17 | `NothingToHarvest` | Nothing to harvest from the yield strategy. |
| 18 | `InvalidRatio` | A configured ratio was out of range. |
| 19 | `ExceedsPayment` | Cumulative refunds would exceed the payment ceiling. |
| 20 | `ReentrancyBlocked` | A guarded, external-call-making entry point was re-entered while a prior invocation was still in progress. |
| 21 | `SelfTransfer` | A refund or withdraw was attempted where the recipient is the contract's own address. |
| 22 | `FloatNotEmpty` | An attempt to change the vault's token address was made while the vault holds a non-zero token balance. |
| 23 | `RefundExpired` | A refund claim was submitted after the policy deadline timestamp passed. |
| 100 | `BatchNotFound` | The requested batch does not exist (or was pruned). |
| 101 | `BatchTooLarge` | A batch larger than `MAX_BATCH_SIZE` was submitted. |
| 102 | `ShardCallFailed` | A shard call returned an unexpected shape. |
| 103 | `DuplicateRoot` | The anchored Merkle root equals the currently active root. |
| 200 | `RootNotFound` | The Merkle root is not in the historical ring buffer. |
| 201 | `ProofTooLong` | The Merkle proof exceeds `MAX_PROOF_LEN`. |
| 202 | `AnchorRateLimited` | An anchor was submitted before the minimum interval elapsed. |
| 203 | `InvalidProof` | The zero-knowledge validity proof is invalid or malformed. |
| 300 | `NoPendingPolicy` | No pending policy change exists to execute. |
| 301 | `TimelockNotExpired` | The policy timelock period has not yet elapsed. |
| 302 | `VdfProofRequired` | A refund was claimed against a policy with a VDF delay configured but no VDF proof was supplied. |
| 303 | `InvalidVdfProof` | The supplied VDF proof failed verification (tampered output or witness, premature proof, or degenerate challenge). |
| 304 | `VdfNotConfigured` | A VDF proof was supplied for a claim against a policy that has no VDF delay configured. |
| 305 | `NoCommit` | A reveal was attempted without a matching, pending commit (commit-reveal). |
| 306 | `CommitAlreadyExists` | A commit was submitted for a commitment hash that already has a pending commitment (commit-reveal). |
| 307 | `CommitMismatch` | The plaintext revealed does not hash to the committed value (commit-reveal). |
| 308 | `CommitDelayNotElapsed` | A reveal was attempted before the minimum commit-reveal ledger delay elapsed (commit-reveal). |
| 309 | `CommitOperationMismatch` | A reveal was attempted under a different operation than the one the commitment was originally bound to (commit-reveal). |
| 310 | `NoOraclesConfigured` | No oracle contracts are whitelisted on the vault. |
| 311 | `OracleAlreadyAdded` | An oracle contract is already on the whitelist. |
| 312 | `OracleNotFound` | The oracle contract is not on the whitelist. |
| 313 | `StaleOracleData` | Every whitelisted oracle returned stale data for the requested feed. |
| 314 | `NoOraclePolicy` | No dynamic oracle policy is configured. |
| 315 | `OraclePolicyDenied` | A refund was rejected because the oracle policy condition was not met. |
| 316 | `InvalidMigrationVersion` | `migrate_state` was called with a target layout version not greater than the current storage version. |

Codes are stable: new variants are appended with fresh values, never renumbered.
Note that `10`/`11` are deliberately unassigned (`MetadataTooLong` and
`AmountExceedsMax` were dead variants removed in #170), and `4`
(`AlreadyRefunded`) is reserved after the `RefundV2` migration — surviving codes
keep their published values.

## Documentation

- [Security Model](docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md)
- [Merkle Tree Structure](docs/ADR-001-merkle-structure.md)
- [Deployments](DEPLOYMENTS.md)
Soroban uses state archival to manage ledger bloat. The contracts are configured with a Time-To-Live (TTL) strategy that ensures active records remain in persistent storage for approximately 30 days (~518,400 ledgers) before they become eligible for archival.

If a `BatchRecord` or `RefundRecord` is archived, it must be restored by submitting a restore transaction before it can be read again. Anyone can proactively prevent archival and reset the 30-day window by calling the public TTL extension functions:
- `extend_batch_ttl(batch_id)` on `ReceiptAnchor`
- `extend_refund_ttl(payment_ref)` on `RefundVault`

For a complete breakdown of what is stored, why it is persistent, and the rent cost implications, read the [Storage Audit](docs/storage-audit.md).

## Amount Semantics

All `RefundVault` amounts are **integer token base units** (`i128`).
No floating-point arithmetic is used anywhere in the contract.

### 7-decimal Stellar assets

Stellar assets such as USDC and native XLM use **7 decimal places**:

| Unit | Base units |
|---|---|
| 1 stroop (smallest) | `1` |
| 1 token | `10_000_000` |
| 5 USDC | `50_000_000` |

Worked example — refunding 5 USDC:

```
5 USDC × 10_000_000 = 50_000_000 base units
```

The contract stores and transfers exactly `50_000_000` as an `i128`.

### RefundMax

`RefundMax` is a **reserved storage key** (`DataKey::RefundMax` in `lib.rs`)
that is not currently set, read, or enforced by any contract function.
The `AmountExceedsMax` error (code 11) is defined but unreachable from the
`refund` path today.

When implemented, `RefundMax` would be an `i128` value in the same integer
base units as all other amounts — e.g., `10_000_000` for a 1-token limit
on a 7-decimal asset.

### refund_window_ledgers

`refund_window_ledgers` is denominated in **Stellar ledgers**, not seconds.
The testnet deployment uses `17_280`:

```
17_280 ledgers × ~5 seconds/ledger ≈ 86_400 seconds ≈ 24 hours
```

This is an **approximate** wall-clock duration because ledger close times
vary.  Setting `0` disables the window entirely (no expiry).

## Live on Testnet

| Contract | ID |
|---|---|
| `ReceiptAnchor` | [`CBHRJU7CF4XIFRNDITFHNQHABKBMFM2FYFHLGWN3JGSFYYCDSMDAWPRV`](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/CBHRJU7CF4XIFRNDITFHNQHABKBMFM2FYFHLGWN3JGSFYYCDSMDAWPRV) |
| `RefundVault` | [`CCMBM44EJUGD52G4LSMGHSXMAH2KSAQZX7VOYY4TTBF5BK4D7M4IHRQA`](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/CCMBM44EJUGD52G4LSMGHSXMAH2KSAQZX7VOYY4TTBF5BK4D7M4IHRQA) |

Batch #1 is anchored and live. You can verify a receipt against it — and watch a
forged receipt get rejected — with two read-only commands that cost nothing:
see [DEPLOYMENTS.md](DEPLOYMENTS.md#verifying-the-live-deployment-yourself).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
rustup target add wasm32v1-none
cargo install --locked stellar-cli
```

### Build and test

```bash
cargo test
cargo build --target wasm32v1-none --release    # wasm artifacts
```

### Deploy your own

```bash
./deploy.sh                      # testnet, identity "deployer"
TOKEN=<usdc-sac-id> ./deploy.sh  # settle refunds in USDC instead of XLM
```

Contract IDs are written to `deployments/<network>.env`.

For mainnet deployment instructions and fee/rent analysis, see the [Mainnet Deployment Guide](docs/MAINNET_DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Testing

Tests run against the Soroban test environment on every push, alongside
`cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy -D warnings`. CI does not swallow failures.

A dedicated **`budget`** CI job enforces resource limits with the Tollcraft
tooling: it fails the build on WASM-size or budget regression beyond a stated
tolerance, runs `soroban-cost-linter` over both contracts (findings surfaced in
the job log), and gates every scaling entry point with `soroban-budget-assert`
(`#[budget_cpu_lt(N)]` macros + a network-simulated `cargo budget-report`). The
measured per-function CPU/memory/read/write costs and the headroom against the
network limits — including the measured justification for `MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 1000`
— are published in [docs/BENCHMARKS.md](docs/BENCHMARKS.md).

Both contracts carry property-based fuzz suites (`src/fuzz_test.rs`) that generate
random operation sequences and assert invariants after every step — pruning stays a
contiguous prefix, Merkle verification rejects every wrong proof shape, vault float
always equals `deposits - refunds - withdrawals`, and a `payment_ref` can never be
refunded twice. CI runs a bounded budget; a longer profile is available locally:

```sh
cargo test -- --ignored          # longer profile
FUZZ_CASES=2000 FUZZ_SEQ_LEN=256 cargo test -- --ignored   # even longer
```

See the module headers in `contracts/*/src/fuzz_test.rs` for the approach and its
limits.
