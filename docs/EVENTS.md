# Accensa Contracts Event Reference

This document describes the events emitted by the `accensa-contracts`. These events form a **public interface** for indexers.

## Stability Policy
As documented in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md), event topics and field names are guaranteed to be stable. Any modification to an event's shape or topic tuple is considered a breaking change.

When consuming these events, indexers should:
- Filter by the exact topic tuple documented below.
- Tolerate any unknown additional fields that may be appended in future non-breaking updates.

## `ReceiptAnchor` Events

`ReceiptAnchor` partitions receipts into logical shards. Every batch-scoped
event therefore carries a leading `shard_id` topic: each `shard_id` owns an
independent batch stream, so `batch_id` alone does not identify a batch.

> **Breaking change (unreleased):** `AnchorEvent` and `PruneEvent` gained a
> leading `shard_id` topic. An indexer filtering on the previous two-element
> tuples matches nothing. Filter on `("anchor_event", shard_id, batch_id)` and
> read `shard_id` from the topics, not the data map.

### 1. `AnchorEvent`
Emitted when a new batch of receipts is anchored by the merchant.

- **Topics**: `("anchor_event", shard_id: u64, batch_id: u64)`
- **Data Map**:
  - `root` (`BytesN<32>`): The Merkle root of the batch.
  - `count` (`u32`): Number of receipts in the batch.
  - `period_start` (`u64`): Start time of the batch period.
  - `period_end` (`u64`): End time of the batch period.
  - `anchored_ledger` (`u32`): The ledger sequence when the batch was anchored.

*Note: The data map is structurally identical to the `BatchRecord` returned by `get_batch(shard_id, batch_id)`.*

### 2. `PruneEvent`
Emitted when old batches are pruned from a shard's stream to reclaim rent. Not
emitted when a call deletes nothing (the cursor did not advance).

- **Topics**: `("prune_event", shard_id: u64, start_batch_id: u64)`
- **Data Map**:
  - `end_batch_id` (`u64`): The upper bound (inclusive) of the pruned range.

The deleted batch ids are exactly `[start_batch_id, end_batch_id]` — inclusive
on both ends — so a reader can drop the whole closed range from its index.

### 3. `ShardCreatedEvent`
Emitted when the router factory-deploys a new storage shard to hold a fresh
capacity range within a logical shard's batch stream. One is emitted per
`SHARD_CAPACITY` (200) batches per `shard_id`, on the anchor that first lands in
the new range.

- **Topics**: `("shard_created_event", shard_id: u64, shard_index: u64)`
- **Data Map**:
  - `shard_address` (`Address`): The deployed `ReceiptShard` contract.
  - `start_batch_id` (`u64`): First batch id this storage shard holds (inclusive).
  - `end_batch_id` (`u64`): Upper bound of the range (exclusive).

*Note: `shard_index` is the capacity index within `shard_id`'s stream, not a
logical shard id. `(shard_id, shard_index)` together identify a storage shard.*

### 4. `InitializedEvent`
Emitted once by `initialize(merchant, shard_wasm_hash)`, after the admin, shard
wasm hash and default configuration have been written.

- **Topics**: `("initialized_event", merchant: Address)`
- **Data Map**:
  - `shard_wasm_hash` (`BytesN<32>`): The `ReceiptShard` wasm the anchor deploys storage shards from.
  - `ledger` (`u32`): The ledger sequence of the initialization.

### 5. `RateLimitUpdatedEvent`
Emitted when the merchant reconfigures the `anchor_batch` token-bucket rate
limit via `set_anchor_rate_limit(burst_capacity, refill_interval_secs)`.

- **Topics**: `("rate_limit_updated_event", previous_burst_capacity: u32, previous_refill_interval_secs: u32)`
- **Data Map**:
  - `new_burst_capacity` (`u32`): The burst capacity in force after the change.
  - `new_refill_interval_secs` (`u32`): The refill interval in force after the change.
  - `ledger` (`u32`): The ledger sequence of the change.

The topics carry the configuration in force *before* the change and the data
map the one in force *after* it, so a reader reconstructing the limiter never
needs to join two events. A `{0, 0}` pair (on either side) means rate limiting
is disabled.

### 6. `AnchorIntervalUpdatedEvent`
Emitted when the merchant reconfigures the minimum interval (in seconds)
between consecutive anchors via `set_min_anchor_interval(interval)`.

- **Topics**: `("anchor_interval_updated_event", previous_interval: u32)`
- **Data Map**:
  - `new_interval` (`u32`): The interval in force after the change; `0` disables the check.
  - `ledger` (`u32`): The ledger sequence of the change.

---

### `ReceiptLeafInsertedEvent`
Emitted when `insert_receipt_leaf` appends a receipt to the continuous-anchoring
incremental Merkle tree (issue #424).

- **Topics**: `("receipt_leaf_inserted_event", leaf_index: u64)`
- **Data Map**:
  - `leaf` (`BytesN<32>`): The appended leaf hash.
  - `root` (`BytesN<32>`): The tree root after the insertion (same sorted-pair, duplicate-odd-node convention as batch roots).

## `ReceiptShard` Events

### `ShardsConsolidated`
Emitted when batch records are migrated from a source storage shard into a destination shard.

- **Topics**: `("shards_consolidated", source_shard_id: u64, destination_shard_id: u64)`
- **Data Map**:
  - `migrated_count` (`u32`): Number of batch records moved by the operation.

The source deletes each record only after the destination returns the identical
record, preserving the complete `BatchRecord` including its Merkle root.

## `RefundVault` Events

### 7. `DepositEvent`
Emitted when the merchant tops up the vault's float.

- **Topics**: `("deposit_event", from: Address)`
- **Data Map**:
  - `amount` (`i128`): The amount deposited (in the token's smallest unit).

### 8. `RefundEvent`
Emitted when a payment is refunded to an agent. A `claim_batch` or
`process_batch` call emits one `RefundEvent` per applied claim, in claim order
(the same event as a single `refund`). A claim that fails emits no event — in
`claim_batch` the whole call reverts; in `process_batch` the claim is simply
not applied and reported as `false` in the returned `Vec<bool>`.

- **Topics**: `("refund_event", payment_ref: BytesN<32>)`
- **Data Map**:
  - `amount` (`i128`): The amount refunded in this call, before the fee is deducted (in the token's smallest unit).
  - `fee` (`i128`): The fee deducted from `amount` and paid to the fee recipient in this call. `0` when no fee is configured.
  - `cumulative_refunded` (`i128`): The running total across all refunds for this `payment_ref` (pre-fee), so an indexer knows the state without summing history.
  - `recipient` (`Address`): The address that received the payout.
  - `ledger` (`u32`): The ledger sequence of the refund.
- **Fee accounting:** `amount == payout + fee` exactly; the total outflow per claim equals `amount`, so fees never expand the `payment_amount` ceiling or the float check. When a fee is charged and no recipient is configured, the fee defaults to the merchant.

*Note: `fee` and `cumulative_refunded` are appended fields; per the stability policy, indexers must tolerate them rather than expect the historical `(amount, recipient, ledger)` shape.*

### 9. `BatchRefundEvent`
Emitted once per `process_batch` call instead of one `RefundEvent` per item.
Keeping the batch to a single compact event is what lets 50+ refunds fit inside
a transaction's 16 KiB contract-event budget (a per-refund event would cap
batches at ~30).

- **Topics**: `("batch_refund_event",)`
- **Data Map**:
  - `payment_refs` (`Vec<BytesN<32>>`): The payment refs, in submission order.
  - `results` (`Vec<bool>`): Per-item outcome, aligned 1:1 with `payment_refs`
    (`true` = refund executed; `false` = item failed validation and was skipped).

*Per-item outcomes are not persisted in the event; call `get_refund(payment_ref)`
to inspect a refund record.*

### 10. `WithdrawEvent`
Emitted when the merchant withdraws funds from the float.

- **Topics**: `("withdraw_event", to: Address)`
- **Data Map**:
  - `amount` (`i128`): The amount withdrawn (in the token's smallest unit).

### 11. `PauseEvent`
Emitted when the merchant pauses the vault, halting deposits, refunds and withdrawals.

- **Topics**: `("pause_event", ledger: u32)`
- **Data Map**: *(empty)*

### 12. `UnpauseEvent`
Emitted when the merchant unpauses the vault.

- **Topics**: `("unpause_event", ledger: u32)`
- **Data Map**: *(empty)*

The `ledger` topic lets an indexer reconstruct pause windows from the event log alone: a vault is paused between a `pause_event` and the next `unpause_event`.

### 13. `RefundWindowUpdatedEvent`
Emitted when the merchant changes the refund window.

- **Topics**: `("refund_window_updated_event", previous_window: u32, new_window: u32)`
- **Data Map**: *(empty)*

Both values are carried so a reader can tell whether a refund rejected at a given ledger was rejected under the old rule or the new one.

### 14. `OraclePolicySetEvent`
Emitted when the merchant installs (or replaces) the dynamic oracle policy
that gates refunds.

- **Topics**: `("oracle_policy_set_event", feed_id: BytesN<32>)`
- **Data Map**:
  - `threshold` (`i128`): The median value (in the feed's scale) at which the condition flips.
  - `refund_when_below` (`bool`): `true` = refunds allowed while the median is strictly below the threshold; `false` = allowed while strictly above.
  - `max_staleness_ledgers` (`u32`): Maximum allowed age of a feed value; `0` = never stale.

The data map carries the full condition, so an indexer can reconstruct the
policy in force from the event log alone.

### 15. `OraclePolicyClearedEvent`
Emitted when the merchant removes the dynamic oracle policy, restoring purely
time-window-based refunds.

- **Topics**: `("oracle_policy_cleared_event", feed_id: BytesN<32>)`
- **Data Map**: *(empty)*

The `feed_id` is the feed of the policy that was in force, captured before it
was removed, so a reader can correlate the clear with the preceding set event.

### 16. `DustSweptEvent`
Emitted when `sweep_dust` recovers the unrefunded remainder of a closed escrow
(strictly below the dust threshold, closed for more than ~90 days) and deletes
its refund record.

- **Topics**: `("dust_swept_event", payment_ref: BytesN<32>)`
- **Data Map**:
  - `amount` (`i128`): The residual transferred to the treasury. `0` when the payment was fully refunded and the record was only reclaimed.
  - `treasury` (`Address`): The address that received the dust.

## `Governance` Events

### `AnonymousVoteCast` (issue #441)
Emitted only after a valid LSAG anonymous vote is accepted. Unlike the
address-based `VoteCast`, the event contains no voter address or key image.

- **Topics**: `("anonymous_vote_cast", proposal_id: u64)`
- **Data Map**:
  - `support` (`bool`): Whether the vote supports the proposal.
  - `weight` (`u64`): The quadratic weight applied to the proposal tally.

An anonymous ring must contain registered voting keys whose members have the
same quadratic weight. This lets the contract update the existing aggregate
tally without learning which ring member signed. The signed message is
available from `get_anonymous_vote_message(proposal_id, support, ring)`.

## `StateChannel` Events

### `ChannelClosedCooperative`
Emitted when `mutual_close` settles a channel from a final balance split
signed by both the sender and the receiver (issue #412). The challenge window
is skipped and the channel's storage entries are deleted.

- **Topics**: `("channel_closed_cooperative", channel_id: u64)`
- **Data Map**:
  - `receiver_balance` (`i128`): Amount paid to the receiver.
  - `sender_balance` (`i128`): Amount returned to the sender.

## `TimePolicy` Events

### `OracleResolutionApplied`
Emitted when a delivery oracle's fresh report decides a refund claim
(issue #426): `Lost` admits the refund, `Delivered` rejects it. A `Delivered`
rejection fails the invocation, so in practice indexers only observe this
event for admitted claims.

- **Topics**: `("oracle_resolution_applied", payment_ref: BytesN<32>)`
- **Data Map**:
  - `oracle` (`Address`): The oracle contract that was consulted.
  - `status` (`DeliveryStatus`): `Lost` or `Delivered`.
  - `reported_at` (`u64`): Timestamp of the oracle's observation.
  - `proof` (`BytesN<32>`): The oracle's opaque evidence.

## `MultisigAccount` Events

### `DailyLimitSet`
Emitted when governance sets or clears a token's daily allowance for
sub-threshold signers (issue #413).

- **Topics**: `("daily_limit_set", token: Address)`
- **Data Map**:
  - `limit` (`i128`): The new daily allowance. `0` means sub-threshold spending of this token is disabled.

### `PausedEvent`
Emitted when the account's emergency pause is engaged, by the account itself
(`threshold` signers) or by its security guardian. While paused the account
refuses to authorize any call except its own `pause`, `unpause`,
`set_guardian` and `rotate_signers_and_threshold`.

- **Topics**: `("paused_event", ledger: u32)`
- **Data Map**:
  - `by` (`Address`): The account's own address (threshold signers) or the guardian.

### `UnpausedEvent`
Emitted when the account's emergency pause is lifted.

- **Topics**: `("unpaused_event", ledger: u32)`
- **Data Map**:
  - `by` (`Address`): The account's own address (threshold signers) or the guardian.

The account is paused between a `paused_event` and the next `unpaused_event`.

### `GuardianSetEvent`
Emitted when the account's threshold signers set, replace or clear the security
guardian.

- **Topics**: `("guardian_set_event",)`
- **Data Map**:
  - `previous` (`Option<Address>`): The guardian before the change.
  - `new` (`Option<Address>`): The guardian after the change; `None` = no guardian.
